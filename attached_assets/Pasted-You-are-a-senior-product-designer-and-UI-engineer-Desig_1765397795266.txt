You are a senior product designer and UI engineer.
Design the complete UI/UX for a mobile app called “Tenant”, a bilingual Tinder-style renting app.
Goal:
A clean, modern, native-feeling mobile UI (iOS & Android)
Following Apple Human Interface Guidelines
Easy to implement in React Native / Expo later
All screens designed with good proportions, spacing, and safe-area awareness
Support for English and Italian text in all user facing strings
1. Brand & Design System
Create a small design system first:
Brand name: Tenant
Tagline EN: “Find homes with a swipe”
Tagline IT: “Trova casa con uno swipe”
Colors (example, feel free to refine):
Primary: a modern blue suitable for housing/apps
Secondary: a softer accent (purple or teal)
Neutrals: proper gray scale for backgrounds, borders, text
Error: red
Success: green
Typography:
Use a clean, rounded sans-serif suited for mobile (e.g. SF Pro style)
Sizes:
H1: 28–32
H2: 22–24
Body: 16
Caption: 12–14
Spacing & layout rules:
Use an 8-point grid (8, 16, 24, 32, etc.)
Respect safe areas at the top and bottom
Minimum tap target height: 44pt
No overlapping elements
Components to define:
Primary button
Secondary button
Text input (with label and error state)
Pill tag (for “Furnished”, “Pets allowed”, price, etc.)
Card component for properties
Card component for tenant profiles
Top navigation header
Bottom navigation tabs (where needed)
Provide a short summary of these in a “design system” section first.
2. Overall App Structure
The app has two roles:
Tenant (Inquilino) – swipes on properties
Landlord (Proprietario) – creates listings and swipes on tenants
Design the following screens with proper hierarchy, spacing, and safe-areas:
Auth & onboarding
Tenant experience
Landlord experience
Matches & messaging / contact
Settings & language switch
For each screen, describe:
Layout
Key components used
How it looks on a 6.1” iPhone style device
3. Screens – Detailed Design
3.1. Welcome / Login / Signup
Full-screen gradient or solid primary background
Centered app name Tenant, tagline beneath
Email + password fields with large rounded inputs
Primary button: “Sign In” / “Accedi”
Secondary text link: “Create an account” / “Crea un account”
Optional social buttons (Google, Apple) with icons
At the top-right or in a small footer, a language toggle (EN / IT)
Everything vertically centered on most screens, scrollable on smaller ones
3.2. Role Selection
After signup, show a simple screen:
Title: “Choose your role” / “Scegli il tuo ruolo”
Two large cards or buttons:
Tenant (Inquilino) – with a small icon of a person/home
Landlord (Proprietario) – with a building/keys icon
Clear selection state and a primary “Continue” button
3.3. Tenant Home – Swipe on Properties
Top app bar with app name or logo, and a small filter icon
Centered property card with:
Top: main property photo
Overlaid price badge in top-right
Below photo: title, city/area, short description
Pill tags: “Furnished”, “Pets allowed”, “2 beds”, etc.
Below the card: a row of two main buttons (or swipe gestures):
❌ Skip (gray outlined circle)
❤️ Like (primary filled circle)
Card must respect margins and never touch edges; add subtle shadow and rounded corners
When no more properties: show an empty state illustration + message
Include the bilingual labels:
Like / Mi piace
Skip / Salta
3.4. Tenant – Favorites Screen
List/grid of saved properties
Each item uses a smaller version of the property card
Tapping opens Property Details
3.5. Property Details
Large image carousel at top
Title + price + city
Detail rows: bedrooms, bathrooms, type, furnished, pets
Description text area
Primary action:
If not yet liked: “Save” / “Salva”
If liked: “Saved” / “Salvata” (with a filled heart)
If there is a match with the landlord: a prominent button:
“Contact owner” / “Contatta proprietario”
Design this with generous spacing and readable text.
3.6. Landlord – My Listings
Simple list of landlord’s properties
Each row: small image, title, city, price, status
Floating action button or top-right button “Add listing” / “Aggiungi annuncio”
3.7. Landlord – Create / Edit Listing
Scrollable form with labeled inputs:
Title / Titolo
City / Città
Area / Zona
Monthly rent / Affitto mensile
Property type / Tipo di immobile
Bedrooms / Camere
Bathrooms / Bagni
Furnished (toggle) / Arredata
Pets allowed (toggle) / Animali ammessi
Description / Descrizione
Image picker area
Primary submit button fixed at bottom with safe area padding
3.8. Landlord – Swipe on Tenants
A mirror of the tenant swipe UI, but with tenant profile cards:
Photo/avatar
Name, age (optional)
Budget range (Budget)
Preferred areas
Move-in date
Short bio
Pill tags for preferences (no pets, student, worker, etc.)
Same Like / Skip buttons at the bottom
3.9. Matches Screen
Tab/list of matches for the logged-in user
Each row:
Avatar / property thumbnail
Name + property title
Last message preview (if chat is included)
Tapping opens Chat or a Contact screen
3.10. Chat / Contact (simple)
Classic chat layout:
App bar with other user’s name + property
Message bubbles, left/right
Text input field with send button
Make it visually clean and easy to read
If you don’t implement real chat, at least design a contact sheet with email/phone and a copy button
3.11. Settings & Profile
Profile header with photo, name, role, city
Options list:
Edit profile
Change language (EN / IT)
About / Terms / Privacy
Logout
4. Navigation
Propose a simple navigation system:
For Tenant:
Bottom tabs: Home (Swipe), Favorites, Matches, Profile
For Landlord:
Bottom tabs: Swipe Tenants, My Listings, Matches, Profile
Make sure tab icons and labels are clear and balanced.
5. Bilingual Text
For each key label, button and title, provide both English and Italian versions, for example:
“Sign In” / “Accedi”
“Create an account” / “Crea un account”
“Find homes with a swipe” / “Trova casa con uno swipe”
Don’t just say “localized”: explicitly list the main strings in both EN & IT so they’re easy to implement.
6. Output Format
First: describe the design system (colors, typography, components).
Then: list each screen with a structured description of layout and components.
Ensure all descriptions are detailed enough that a developer can implement them in React Native / Expo without guessing.
